## Useful Gulp tasks

This project uses the Gulp task runner, here are some useful tasks:

- `gulp build`: builds the publishable assets and places them into the `.tmp/build` folder.
- `gulp clean`: removes all generated files.
- `gulp`: runs the `build` task, starts Browsersync to serve the files and watches for file changes.
